### Story

I'm developing this application for educational purposes and for some personal needs especially for data table management to simplify the work of editing tables for non-relational databases.
I also like the idea of creating a complete and efficient application in Angular, including the most advanced technologies provided by Typescript.

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)

### Installation (local)

```
git clone 'https://github.com/RikSteed/JTT'
cmd JTT
git checkout -b develop
git pull
npm install
ng serve

```

### Demo

A demo of the project is not yet available, as soon as the initial developments are completed (normal flow) an online beta will be published
